Homework Assignment 3 (due May 3, 2pm):
Implement an emulator of a DLX-like (RISC) machine.
Make sure your emulator also contains a loader that starts the main routine of the executable.
Implement the following program in your machine code calculating the n'th Fibonacci number (iteratively).
    int fib (int n) {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 1;
        int c;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
        return b;
    }
If your compiler targets an existing processor, e.g. x86, implement at least the above program in its assembly language.
Demonstrate that your Fibonacci calculation provides the correct result.
