# Simple Pascal Compiler

This is a compiler based on Pascal Programming Language.  To start with the project, we have written a scanner which scan files and itself. The scanner checks every symbol or character in a file till it reaches the end of the file.

Instructions to build and test:

On commandline/console:

	make	    ---- to build the project.
	make test   ---- to run tests.
	make clean  ---- to remove/delete unncessary files after building.
